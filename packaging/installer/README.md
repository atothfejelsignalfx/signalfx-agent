# SignalFx Agent Installer Script

This directory contains a convenience script that can be used to quickly
install the agent on any supported Linux environment.  This is **not** the
recommended way of installing the agent in production environments, but is
convenient for testing and/or proof of concepts.

The latest version of the built installer script lives at https://<insert URL
