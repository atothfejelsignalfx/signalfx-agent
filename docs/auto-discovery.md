# Endpoint Discovery

The agent's observers are responsible for discovering service endpoints.  For
these service endpoints to result in a new monitor instance that is watching
that endpoint, you must apply _discovery rules_ to your monitor configuration.
Every monitor that supports monitoring specific services (i.e. not a static
monitor like the `collectd/cpu` monitor) can be configured with a
`discoveryRule` config option that specifies a rule using a mini rule language.

For example, to monitor a Redis instance that has been discovered by a
container-based observer, you could use the following configuration:

```yaml
  monitors:
    - type: collectd/redis
      discoveryRule: container_image =~ "redis" && port == 6379
```

## Rule DSL

A rule is an expression that is matched against each discovered endpoint to
determine if a monitor should be active for a particular endpoint. The basic
operators are:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| == | Equals |
| != | Not equals |
| < | Less than |
| <= | Less than or equal |
| > | Greater than |
| >= | Greater than or equal |
| =~ | Regex matches |
| !~ | Regex does not match |
| && | And |
| || | Or | 

See [the govaluate
documentation](https://github.com/Knetic/govaluate/blob/master/MANUAL.md) for
all available operators.

The variables available in the expression are dependent on what observer you
are using.  The following three variables are common to all observers:

 - `host` (string): The hostname or IP address of the discovered endpoint
 - `port` (integer): The port number of the discovered endpoint
 - `port_type` (`UDP` or `TCP`): Whether the port is TCP or UDP

**See [Observers](./observer-config.md) for a list of observers and what
discovery rule variables they provide.**

In addition, these extra functions are provided:

 - `Get(map, key)` - retrieves the value from map with the given key
 - `Contains(map, key)` - returns true if key is inside map, otherwise false

There are no implicit rules built into the agent, so each must be specified
manually in the config file in conjunction with monitor that should monitor the
discovered service.

## Troubleshooting

The simplest way to see what services an instance of the agent has discovered,
along with the variables that can be matched against this service, is to run
the command `signalfx-agent status`.  Near the end of this output will be a
list of discovered endpoints that the agent knows about.

## Manually Defined Services

While service discovery is useful, sometimes it is just easier to manually
define services to monitor.  This can be done by setting the `host` and
`port` option in a monitor's config to the host/port that you need to
monitor.  These two values are the core of what the auto discovery mechanism
provides for you automatically.

For example (making use of YAML references to reduce repetition):

```yaml
  - &es
    type: collectd/elasticsearch
    username: admin
    password: s3cr3t
    host: es
    port: 9200

  - <<: *es
    host: es2
    port: 9300
```

This would monitor two ElasticSearch instances at the given host/port and would
use the same username and password given in the top-level monitor config to
connect to both of them.  If you needed different configuration for the two ES
hosts, you could simply define two monitor configurations, each with one
service endpoint.

It is invalid to have manually defined service endpoints and a discovery rule
on a single monitor configuration.
