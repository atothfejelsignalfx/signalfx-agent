# docker-container-stats

 This monitor reads container stats from a
Docker API server.  It is meant as a metric-compatible replacement of our
[docker-collectd](https://github.com/signalfx/docker-collectd-plugin)
plugin, which scales rather poorly against a large number of containers.

This currently does not support CPU share/quota metrics.

Requires Docker API version 1.22+.


Monitor Type: `docker-container-stats`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/docker)

**Accepts Endpoints**: No

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dockerURL` | no | `string` | The URL of the docker server (**default:** `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`) |
| `timeoutSeconds` | no | `integer` | The maximum amount of time to wait for docker API requests (**default:** `5`) |
| `labelsToDimensions` | no | `map of string` | A mapping of container label names to dimension names. The corresponding label values will become the dimension value for the mapped name.  E.g. `io.kubernetes.container.name: container_spec_name` would result in a dimension called `container_spec_name` that has the value of the `io.kubernetes.container.name` container label. |
| `excludedImages` | no | `list of string` | A list of filters of images to exclude.  Supports literals, globs, and regex. |




## Metrics

This monitor emits the following metrics.  Note that configuration options may
cause only a subset of metrics to be emitted.
