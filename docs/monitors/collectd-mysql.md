# collectd/mysql

 Montiors a MySQL database server using collectd's
[MySQL plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:MySQL).


Monitor Type: `collectd/mysql`

[Monitor Source Code](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/tree/master/internal/monitors/collectd/mysql)

**Accepts Endpoints**: **Yes**

**Multiple Instances Allowed**: Yes

## Configuration

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `port` | **yes** | `integer` |  |
| `name` | no | `string` |  |
| `databases` | no | `list of object (see below)` | A list of databases along with optional authentication credentials. |
| `username` | no | `string` | These credentials serve as defaults for all databases if not overridden |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |
| `reportHost` | no | `bool` | A SignalFx extension to the plugin that allows us to disable the normal behavior of the MySQL collectd plugin where the `host` dimension is set to the hostname of the MySQL database server.  When `false` (the recommended and default setting), the globally configured `hostname` config is used instead. (**default:** `false`) |


The **nested** `databases` config object has the following fields:

| Config option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | **yes** | `string` |  |
| `username` | no | `string` |  |
| `password` | no | `string` |  |


<!--- This is pretty ugly all this repetition, but some config has nesting to three layers.  Would probably be better to flatten them before rendering or use a template engine with partials. --->
