# collectd/cpu

 This monitor collects cpu usage data using the
collectd `cpu` plugin.  It aggregates the per-core CPU data into a single
metric and sends it to the SignalFx Metadata plugin in collectd, where the
raw jiffy counts from the `cpu` plugin are converted to percent utilization
(the `cpu.utilization` metric).

See https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:CPU
